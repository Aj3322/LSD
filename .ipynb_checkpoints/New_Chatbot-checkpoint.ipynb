The racing heart and difficulty breathing you experienced are likely symptoms of an anxiety attack, which can be triggered by stress and emotional distress. Here are some things you can do to help manage your anxiety and cope with your feelings: Seek professional help: A therapist or counselor can provide support, coping mechanisms, and strategies for managing anxiety. Connect with others: Talk to trusted friends, family members, or support groups who can offer empathy and understanding. Practice relaxation techniques: Deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety symptoms. Exercise regularly: Physical activity releases endorphins that have mood-boosting effects. Get enough sleep: Sleep deprivation can worsen anxiety. Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep each night. Avoid alcohol and drugs: While these substances may provide temporary relief, they can actually worsen anxiety in the long run. Take care of your physical health: Eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of water, and get regular checkups. Physical health can impact mental health. Be patient with yourself: Grief and healing take time. Don't expect to feel better overnight. Allow yourself time to process your emotions and adjust to the changes in your life. Remember that you are not alone in this. Many people experience anxiety and loss. Reaching out for help and practicing self-care can help you cope and improve your well-being\")\n",
